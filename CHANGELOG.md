# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Load tower and enemy stats from external JSON files for easier tuning.
- Add GDScript stubs for damage calculation and targeting priorities with accompanying JS tests.
- Railgun beam now deals damage along its full length to the grid edge while range still only limits targeting.
- Added costs for specialized towers and display them in the upgrade menu.
- Added a 5s delay before waves begin after the previous wave is cleared.
- Fixed upgrade menu height so Sell button doesn't shift when specialization options appear.
